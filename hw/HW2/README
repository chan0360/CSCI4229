  DUE: 6/15/2014
  Description: Displays a small town with houses. Each house 
               is an instance of a base 'house' object and is 
               transformed to its final shape and position. Multiple
               projections are supported as well as rotations and zooming.
  Compiling:   Run 'make;./hw2' to compile and run. Otherwise 
               run 'gcc -Wall -O3 -o hw2 hw2.c -lglut -lGLU -lGL -lm'
               and run './hw2'
  Controls: <LEFT-ARROW>/<RIGHT-ARROW>  Rotate scene left/right
            <UP-ARROW>/<DOWN-ARROW>     Rotate scene up/down
            <PAGE-UP>/<PAGE-DOWN>       Zoom in and out
            '+'/'-'                     Change field of view of perspective
            'm'                         Switch between orthogonal and perspective projections
            'a'                         Turn axes visibility on or off
            '0'                         Set rotation angles both equal to 0
