  Description: Simulates raindrops on a small pool of water. This is done
               by using an approximation to the wave equation. Rather than 
               using a full mathematical model, the height at a certain point is 
               estimated by averaging the heights of the point around it. This effectively
               simulates conservation of energy and creates a wave effect. The scene is textured
               and the water surface is reflective.
  Compiling:   Run 'make;./water' to compile and run. Otherwise 
               run 'gcc -Wall -O3 -o water water.c -lglut -lGLU -lGL -lm'
               and run './water'
  Controls: <SPACE>                     Create raindrop
            'l' or 'L'                  Enable lighting
            'Q'/'q'                     Change water transparency
            'A'/'a'                     Increase/decrease ambient light
            '['/']'                     Raise/lower light source
            <LEFT-ARROW>/<RIGHT-ARROW>  Rotate scene left/right
            <UP-ARROW>/<DOWN-ARROW>     Rotate scene up/down
            <PAGE-UP>/<PAGE-DOWN>       Zoom in and out
            '+'/'-'                     Change field of view of perspective
            '0'                         Set rotation angles both equal to 0
            


  Key features:
    - Realistic looking water simulation
    - Waves bounce off of walls and conserve energy
    - Damping on waves can be modified by changing the fluid viscosity
    - The surface appears reflective, but instead uses a clever texturing to avoid 
      extra computation and shaders
    - Lighting is realistic

  Acknowledgements: Water movement is based off of simulation written in 
                    Pascal found here: http://www.sulaco.co.za/opengl_project_water_ripples.htm

  Time to Complete: 16 hrs (I know it doesn't look it, but I was banging my head against the 
                    wall trying to figure out the wave movements for quite some time)
